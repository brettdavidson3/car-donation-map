car-donation-map
================

Implemented for the National Civic Day of Hacking, this project uses census data to find regions most in need of your car donation.

Currently, there are two prototypes available:

top_by_percent.html, which shows the top ten counties in Colorado by percent of households that don't have cars
top_by_count.html, which shows the top ten counties in Colorado by total number of households that don't have cars

We would like to eventually move this prototype into an application where you could enter your address and get back a map of the closest places in need.
